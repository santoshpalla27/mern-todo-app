# Three-Tier Employee Application

## Overview
The Three-Tier Employee Application is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It is designed as a scalable and reliable solution, leveraging modern DevOps practices and cloud-native tools for infrastructure provisioning, deployment, and monitoring.

---

## Architecture
The application architecture is based on a three-tier model:

1. **Presentation Layer:** React.js front-end for user interaction.
2. **Logic Layer:** Express.js and Node.js back-end for handling business logic and API endpoints.
3. **Data Layer:** MongoDB database for storing employee records and related data.

---

## Infrastructure Provisioning

### Terraform

Infrastructure provisioning is automated using **Terraform**, with the following components:

- **State Management:**
  - Backend: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
  - State Locking: DynamoDB for concurrency control

- **AWS Resources Provisioned:**
  - Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster
  - EC2 instances for worker nodes and additional services

### Configuration Management

**Ansible** is used to automate the installation of dependencies and configuration of provisioned resources.

---

## Application Deployment

### Kubernetes
Application manifests are created using Kubernetes YAML definitions for:

- Deployments
- Services
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- Persistent Volumes and Claims

The application is deployed to the EKS cluster using these manifests.

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

**Jenkins** is used to implement the CI/CD pipeline, integrating the following tools:

1. **SonarQube** for code quality and static analysis.
2. **Trivy** for container image vulnerability scanning.
3. **Git** for version control and repository management.
4. **Docker** for building containerized applications.
5. **ArgoCD** for continuous deployment to Kubernetes.

---

## Monitoring and Observability

**Prometheus** and **Grafana** are utilized for application and infrastructure monitoring:

- **Prometheus:** Metrics collection and alerting.
- **Grafana:** Visualization of metrics with custom dashboards for performance insights.

---

## Key Features

- Fully automated infrastructure provisioning and configuration.
- Secure and scalable Kubernetes-based deployment.
- End-to-end CI/CD pipeline ensuring quality and security.
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability.
- Cloud-native architecture leveraging AWS services.
